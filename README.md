# whatsapp-analysis
A personal project aimed at improving my data visualization skills and gaining experience with python and github. It essentially consists of different functions to parse messages, filter data and create tables useful to analyse instant messaging conversations that have been exported to a .txt.

**Files organization**
The most important file is the whatsapp_tools.py, which basically consists of a lib of python funtions for transforming data read from a txt file that is formatted in one of the main whatsapp patterns (ios, poco or android). The other files are examples of scripts that use one or more of the functions present in the library in order to visualize the data of the chat file, with word_histogram.py being the most complex of them.
